Unfortunately, AAFE’s office closed at 6pm which meant after my hour commute from my high school, I would only be able to work 2 hours a day.</p>

A few friends and I applied and started working as tutors for third to fifth graders. We had a flexible schedule which meant I was able to finally join a few clubs. I chose Key Club and The Urban Dance Club, which proved to be great opportunities to give back to society, and to socialize and connect with school mates.</p>

Although I started out as an assistant bookkeeper, I eventually transitioned into hostess, delivery manager, and then assistant manager due to the needs of the restaurant. I would continue to work here for the entirety of my senior year of high school and during some breaks (summer 2015, winter 2015) from college. It’s crazy for me to look back on this year and realize that I attended school from 8am-3pm and then I would work from 4pm-9pm, getting home sometimes at 10pm and I did this usually 4-5 days a week, sometimes on the weekends instead of weekdays. </p>

Luckily, at this point, technology helped with everything. I utilized a hospitality focused job platform called Harri.com and found a job at a high-end steakhouse in Midtown, next to the Palace Hotel. I created lasting relationships with my fellow hostesses and supervisors, and I was asked to come back for the next summer. <br> So, in the summer of 2015, the summer before my sophomore year of college, I began working two jobs: hostessing at Maloney & Porcelli and being the assistant manager for Gigino Trattoria. I continued to work at both locations in the winter of 2015 as well.</p>

              <p class="timeline-summary">The summer before my senior year of college, I found a job at MAMO, a cute French Riveria inspired restaurant in SoHo. The owners had another restaurants— a celebrity favorite in Antibes called Mama Michelangelo. The NYC location had quite a few celebrity diners as well, such as Justin Timberlake, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lopez, Alex Rodriguez, and Nick Jonas. JT was my favorite, he came in more than once and treated the staff like we were his friends! I spent the whole summer training and testing other hostesses (after being trained myself) to prepare for my imminent departure in late August, because they were quite picky with staff and rightfully so! MAMO was probably my absolute favorite restaurant to work at despite my short tenure. It wasn’t only because I was able to meet celebrities, I was also able to sit instead of stand for 6 hours! But more importantly, they really went above and beyond to provide exceptional customer service and every one of the staff members were truly fantastic. </p>

              <p class="timeline-summary">A few weeks into working at MAMO, I decided I had the time and energy for a second job (partly due to my ability to sit instead of stand at MAMO, which is unheard of in the hostessing/hospitality world). I started working as a breakfast host at Nickel & Diner. It was only a few blocks away from MAMO and the two schedules never overlapped. It was a new trendy and casual dining spot at the time so it was always busy—but I love busy.</p>

They are currently ranked #23 in The World’s 50 Best Restaurants 2019. Cosme was by far the most high end restaurant with the largest team I’d ever worked with. I started working here in the winter of my senior year of college and again the following summer. Winter is a very busy season for all restaurants, especially so for Cosme. We sometimes had 5 girls at the host stand and the sheer volume of us sometimes startled and intimidated guests. ‘You outnumber us!’ -party of 4.</p>

              <p class="timeline-summary">While completing my bachelors degree with a final online course, I started working at SUGARFISH by sushi nozawa, a very popular sushi restaurant originating from California. I started out at the Flatiron location and moved to the SoHo location when during it’s grand opening. I was the sole hostess and helped the SoHo team build out a foundational 8-person host team before being promoted to Server. Sugarfish is a very different type of restaurant when compared to the others where I’ve worked. Their whole motto is efficiency, it applies to the back of house, front of house, management—everything. In SoHo, we would often find ourselves short-staffed because it wasn’t a very stable location. We would go the first few hours with just a few customers to having 20 parties on the wait list. It was at here that I learned just how crucial teamwork, collaboration, and morale is to keeping a team running. If one team member slacked, the weight was felt on everyone else. Here, I also trained dozens of people and again learned how much I loved to share knowledge and guide people through unfamiliar processes.</p>

              <p class="timeline-summary">After 6 years in hospitality gig industry, I finally began my search for a stable, full-time job. I scoured Indeed and AngelList for hospitality-tech companies and I was fortunate enough to have my first interview with an amazing company founded by amazing people—SixPlus. Have you ever called a restaurant to ask about having a large party or private event in their space? Did they take down your contact info and say someone will reach out but you never heard from them again? SixPlus aims to eliminate this outdated and inefficient process by creating a marketplace where clients can browse available venues and then directly connect with the managers in charge of said venue. <br> Since SixPlus is an early stage startup, I wear a lot of hats. Although my title is Customer Relations & Office Admin, my duties range from on boarding clients, troubleshooting bugs, managing customer relationships, experiential marketing, sales, and business development.</p>

              <p class="timeline-summary">SixPlus, along with the rest of the hospitality industry (and many other industries), was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. The whole team, with the exception of the software developers and the co-founders, was furloughed. I took this opportunity to teach myself something that always interested me, web development and programming. From March until now, I’ve learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. Next up is Node JS. I’m planning to continue learning more languages and useful programs while I work full-time. I love spending my time productively, so by default, I love learning :). Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any opportunities, questions, or comments! I love hearing feedback. </p>
