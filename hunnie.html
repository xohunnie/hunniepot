          <p> This marks the beginning of my hospitality career at various New York City restaurants during winter and summer breaks from college. Although I preferred to stay at the same restaurants, that didn't always work out because of limited hours for a restaurant's current front of house staff. </p>

          <p>  Maloney & Porcelli is a main stay steakhouse in Midtown.  I juggled seating and coat check, and worked private events in the Skylight Room. I first joined in the winter of 2014, left when my spring semester started, and then came back the following summer at the request of my manager. </p>

          <p> MAMO is a beautiful Italian-French restaurant in SoHo with celebrity clientele. Their motto is to provide every customer with an affectionate Italian and French Provencal dining experience. Due to that, I was able  to say 'yes' to almost every customer request, allowing me to provide the most exceptional service. </p>

          <p>Cosme</p>
          <p> Cosme needs no introduction. They are ranked 23 on the World's 50 Best Restaurants. Working at Cosme was a really unique experience because during the winter months we had a team of 5 at the front door juggling seating, phone calls, coat check, and wait lists. I first worked during the winter and then I was asked to notify my manager when I'd be back in the summer due to great work ethic and strong communication skills. </p>
